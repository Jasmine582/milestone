                    <p>I am an inspiring minimalist who <span>loves</span> to travel and spend time with family and friends. My love languages are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and of course <span>food</span>!</p>
                    <p>After working in Human Resources for over a decade. I decided it was time for a change. When <span>Covid-19</span> happened, it pushed me out of my comfort zone and into tech. I discovered front-end development on a whelm and I am happy I did! Building a <span>website</span> from scratch and troubleshooting an issue on my own have been really rewarding, because I am able to use my organization skills and keen eye for detail to write clean and efficient <span>code</span>.</p>
